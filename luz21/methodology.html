							<p>For the completion of this masterâ€™s thesis, the initial work was focused on the theoretical part starting with the
								cartographic project definition. The objective and project specifications were identified and the contents of the atlas
								were finalized following a consultation with the thesis supervisor. This was followed by preliminary research on the
								potential data sources as well as on scientific literature about the topic. Important issues focusing on thematic
								cartography and map design were explored together with the state of atlas creation specifically on global topics.</p>
							<p>Due to the broad range of topics included in the atlas, a great deal of time was devoted to data collection and
								processing. The initial part of data collection was spent on the acquisition of GIS data for the reference map and the
								environmental topics especially since the datasets for the other topics were still unavailable until the end of January
								2021. Once all the necessary datasets were obtained, data processing and harmonization using GIS software were conducted
								before the actual production of maps and other graphical contents of the atlas.</p>
							<p>Map and chart design improvements (e.g. color management, color standardization, etc.) and the designing of the final
								atlas layout were accomplished using desktop publishing programs (DTP). A short user testing was also performed after
								the creation of the final atlas to evaluate the usability of the generated cartographic product. Several consultations
								regarding the map design were conducted together with the thesis supervisors to ensure that the final product will
								maximize its usability.</p>
